# TrainScheduler

This is my train scheduler app. You can use this app to view current running 
trains, the frequency they run at and when the next train is scheduled to arrive 
at the specified location. You can also add your own train to the list by entering 
the train name, destination, what time the first train runs and the frequency. The 
app will then calculate the next arrival of that train and displey all of that 
information in a new row in the Current Train Schedule table.


This assignment was fun for me and by far the best thing I've turned in! I'm very
proud of my work and happy that it's functioning the way I want it to. I was able to 
use the examples we did in class effectively and those activitites were incredibly helpful
in completing my assignment.
